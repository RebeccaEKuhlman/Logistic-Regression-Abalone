As in previous labs, also detail how good the classifier needs to perform in order to be useful.\n",

Use pre-processing methods (as needed) for dimensionality reduction, scaling, etc. Remove variables that are not needed/useful for the analysis. Describe the final dataset that is used for classification/regression (include a description of any newly formed variables you created). Provide a breakdown of the variables after preprocessing (such as the mean, std, etc. for all variables, including numeric and categorical).\n",
